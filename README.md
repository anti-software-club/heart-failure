# Regression Explorations

Various projects for performing regression analysis to better understand concepts related to diagnostics and general modeling. Many explorations are linear models, but I also look at models requiring logistic regression and Poisson regression for binary and count responses respectively, and also include nonlinear regression models that involve various feature maps. Other machine learning models (SVMs, CART, neural nets) are not explored here.

Most files with code are RMD files, some files may be Python scikit-learn code.
